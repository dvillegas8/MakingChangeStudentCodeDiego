After thinking with Caden on how to approach this problem, I am going to get the least amount of coins used (using the biggest value coins). Then I will convert those bigger coins into smaller value coins and somehow calculate how many different combinations we will make. |

Basically, instead of changing the target word, we would change the specific coins we can use. Otherwise, more board work and ended with a for loop that does modulus operations. |
| Feb 2   | 1:30 - 3:00 PM | Started working on a different function where it takes a certain coins array and finds a way to sum to the target. The way I did this was I start from the biggest coin and mod it and continue. If my remainder eventually reaches 0, I add one to the counter. I also have a "base case" where if I only have one coin, I just return either 1 or 0 depended if my remainder is 0 or not. I know this algorithm doesnt work because if you have nickels and pennies for example and your target is 15, it is only going to return 1 way (which would be only nickels, even though you can also have pennies as well). |
