After thinking with Caden on how to approach this problem, I am going to get the least amount of coins used (using the biggest value coins). Then I will convert those bigger coins into smaller value coins and somehow calculate how many different combinations we will make. |

Basically, instead of changing the target word, we would change the specific coins we can use. Otherwise, more board work and ended with a for loop that does modulus operations. |
| Feb 2   | 1:30 - 3:00 PM | Started working on a different function where it takes a certain coins array and finds a way to sum to the target. The way I did this was I start from the biggest coin and mod it and continue. If my remainder eventually reaches 0, I add one to the counter. I also have a "base case" where if I only have one coin, I just return either 1 or 0 depended if my remainder is 0 or not. I know this algorithm doesnt work because if you have nickels and pennies for example and your target is 15, it is only going to return 1 way (which would be only nickels, even though you can also have pennies as well). |

From what I understand, you want to have 2 recursive steps where you include some of the coins and some you do. |

I basically have base cases indicating when the target is 0, a negative number, or out of bounds. I also finished adding he recursive steps where you exclude and include certain coins and sometimes change the target. The next step will be to make a faster run time using memoization or tabulation. |
| Feb 7   |  2:30 - 3:10   |                        Trying to implement memoization. I did this by creating 2d array where the number of rows is the potential coins & the number of columns is the potential target words. I then updated this array in the recursion function after we get sum. I made the current coin we were on + the current target (in the array) equal to the sum. I then added a base case where if we have visited before, return whatever value is stored. It works for all of the base cases. However, in one of them we have a stack overflow I believe because it returns a negative number. Not sure how to fix that. |
